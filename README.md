# Solving-Linear-Systems-Study-NA
A two part study experiment on solving linear pentadiagonal systems. We make a comparison between cramer's algorithm, gaussian elimination, PTRANSII and Matlab's algorithm for solving linear systems. 
On the first study experiment we compare the execution time of these 4 algorithms for solving pentadiagonal systems of dimensions 4x4 up to 35x35. For each dimension we take as a result the average execution time of 10 random systems and then we plot the results of every algorithm in a Time=F(dimension) figure.
On the second study experiment we only compare the "champions" which are Matlab's algorithm and PTRANSII. To see a clear difference in their performances we take results in the same way as before but for dimensions 4x4 up to 2000x2000 with a 50-step increment(e.g. 4x4 - 54x54 etc.).
